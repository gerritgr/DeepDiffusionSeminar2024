# Consistency Models Notebook
The notebook is self-contained, so as long as you have python with `jupyter`, `torch` and `torchvision` installed all you need to do is run the notebook. The notebook will download the dataset.

All the images and pretrained models are included in the [repository](https://github.com/BartekPog/Consistency-Models-Tutorial/blob/main/readme.md). If you decide to use google colab, you can run the notebook there as well -- you just need to upload the pretrained models to the colab environment, or preform full training.
